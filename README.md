
# 🔐 Detecting Web Attacks with End-to-End Deep Learning

This project aims to detect web-based cyber attacks using a combination of a Django web framework and deep learning models powered by TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to develop an intelligent system capable of identifying malicious HTTP requests and preventing potential security breaches.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Web attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF are among the most common threats faced by web applications. This project leverages deep learning to automate the detection of such attacks using request-based analysis and classification.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Django** – Backend web framework (Python)
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – For training and deploying deep learning models
- **Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy** – Data preprocessing and evaluation
- **SQLite** – Default database used for development
- **Bootstrap / HTML** – Basic frontend integration
